          In my free time I like to practice inline skating and roam around
          the streets of Dublin on my <a href='https://www.rollerblade.com/products/metroblade/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Rollerblades</a>.
          This urban sport typically involves dodging tourists on Grafton Street

          I'm passionate about retrocomputing,
          when I get the chance I collect old computers from the
          80s and I'm really fond of skeuomorphic design of 90s and early 2000s UIs.
